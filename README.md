# Assignment2duckpet
For assignment 2 I created an app using android studio and wrote code in kotlin. I created graphics for my app using the image editor on pixilart.com to create variations of the duckling character

I started my app by creating a start up screen showing the duckling character and a button that would allow the user to start playing the game by creating a new activity that the app would go to once the button is tapped.

I created a new activity where the user would be able to click/tap buttons that would change the image of the duckling character to represent the action

I made use of coroutines in kotlin to create seperate count-down timers that would show the different states being decreased over time. I added progress bars to show the current states of the character that can be increased by clicking/tapping the corresponding buttons.

I made use of ChatGPT to get examples of code to implement coroutines and Github.com to create a repository to upload and update the project.
